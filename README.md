# AmFam Chatbot Intent Dataset (ACID)
Amfam chatbot intent dataset(ACID) contains 174 unique intents related to topics driven by customers contacting an insurance company. Each intent represents a particular course of action for the chatbot. The intent prediction dataset was collected from past interaction of customers with our service representatives at American Family Insurance. Subject matter experts created different intent categories and handpicked examples belonging to each intent category. The dataset contains 175 unique intents. It is split into a  training set that contains a total of 11,130 examples and  test set that contains total of 11,042 examples. The distribution across the intent classes is highly skewed with the smallest intent class containing  10 examples and the biggest class containing 378 examples in the training set.
